Part 2:
<ul>
  <li><b>Branch</b> - 
    A branch is contained within your repository, but the code you write inside of it won't affect the main branch until your merge the two together. Branches let you experiment with your code safely, because it won't affect your main branch until you merge the branches.
  </li>
  <li><b>Clone</b> - 
    A clone is a copy of your repository that is stored on your local machine. This means you can edit your code offline. The clone is connected to the online repository, so you can push your changes made on your clone onto your online repository.
  </li>
  <li><b>Commit</b> - 
    A commit is like a save file of your repository. You can go back to these save files anytime you'd like, and even write a message with your commit.
  </li>
</ul>
