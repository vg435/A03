<h1>Part 1: How to use Webstorm</h1>
<ol>
  <li>First, you have to download the software from a website like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Jetbrains</a>.
  </li>
  <li>When installing the files, you can configure Webstorm for your use.
  </li>
  <li>After installing, you must activate your license in order to use Webstorm.
  </li>
  <li> Once you install Webstorm, it's recommended you go into your settings and link Git and your GitHub account to Webstorm. You can find this in the "Version Control" section in your settings (JetBrains, n.d.). You can install Git at <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a> and create a GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li> To start using Webstorm, click "File" and create a "New Project". After you've created a New Project, you must add a "New File" in order to start writing code.
  </li>
  <li> To upload your code onto Github, click "VCS" and select "Create Git Repository..." or "Share Project on Github". You can only do this once you've downloaded Git or created a Github account. You can also enable "Version Control Integration" to connect to Git.
  </li>
</ol>

<br>
<h1>Part 1: How to use Github</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Sign up for Github. You can create a GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Create a new repository. These are essentially the folders for your projects and they can hold store your project files. Your repositories can either be public or private.</li>
  <li>Once you've made a repository, you should create a branch. Your repository will always automatically have a master branch.</li>
  <li>To commit changes in your branch, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the button saying "Commit changes".</li>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Part 1: How to use Git</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Install Git at <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a>.</li>
  <li>Once you've installed the app, open up Git GUI and create a new repository. You add this local repository to GitHub.</li>
  <li>Create a branch on Git. You can also create a new branch by running "git branch [new_branch_name]" on GitBash.</li>
  <li>After you've added some files to your repository, you can create a commit.</li>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Part 2: Glossary</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Branch</b> - 
    A branch is contained within your repository, but the code you write inside of it won't affect the main branch until you merge the two together (Github, n.d.). Branches let you experiment with your code safely, because it won't affect your main branch until you merge the branches.
  </li>
  <li><b>Clone</b> - 
    A clone is a copy of your repository that is stored on your local machine. This means you can ed (Github, n.d.)it your code offline. The clone is connected to the online repository, so you can push your changes made on your clone onto your online repository.
  </li>
  <li><b>Commit</b> - 
    A commit is a save point of your repository (Github, n.d.). You can go back to these save files anytime you'd like, and even write a message with your commit, so you know what changes were made.
  </li>
  <li><b>Fetch</b> - 
    When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from your remote repository onto your local repository without committing them (Github, n.d.). This lets you review changes before committing them.
  </li>
  <li><b>GIT</b> - 
    Git is an open source program that tracks changes in text files.
  </li>
  <li><b>Github</b> - 
    Github is an online hosting service for software made using Git (Github, n.d.). You can host code and webpages on GitHub.
  </li>
  <li><b>Merge</b> - 
    Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them to another (Github, n.d.). 
  </li>
  <li><b>Merge Conflict</b> - 
    A merge conlict is when there are differences between merged branches (Github, n.d.). Two people could edit the same file at the same time, or someone could delete it. The conflict has to be resolved before you can merge the branches.
  </li>
  <li><b>Push</b> - 
    When you push something, you're sending your committed changes to a remote repository on Github (Github, n.d.). You can make your changes locally, but not have the same changes on the remoate repository, which is why people make pushes.
  </li>
  <li><b>Pull</b> - 
    When you pull something, you're bringing in changes or merges (Github, n.d.).
  </li>
  <li><b>Remote</b> - 
    A remote is another version or your repository or branch hosted on a server, like Github (Github, n.d.). They can be connected to local clones so you can sync changes made on both files.
  </li>
  <li><b>Repository</b> - 
    Repositories are like project folders. They hold all of the project's files and saves each file's revision history (Github, n.d.). Multiple people can work on one repository, and repositories can be made public or private.
  </li>
